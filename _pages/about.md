I build and ship ML systems that work at scale—across industry, research, and open source. Currently finishing my MS in Data Science at USC, I’ve deployed production NLP and document AI at Intuit (AutoML pipelines, BERT, PySpark, Kubeflow, Sagemaker) powering TurboTax, QuickBooks, and ProSeries. My work has replaced manual processes, delivered major cost savings, and scaled to millions of users.

**Research & Projects**:

- SwarmGuard: SOTA multimodal misinformation detection (GNN, vision, BERT)

- Between Silence and Speech: New evaluation and mitigation framework for political bias in LLMs

- ViStA: Open video streaming & analytics benchmark (ISPASS)

- VetaQL: Graph-based semantic video querying & recsys (ASIANCON)

- U-Net segmentation for remote sensing (IGARSS, ISRO collab)

- Shipped open-source projects: recsys, sentiment analysis, and real-time flight DBs (Spark/Kafka/MySQL/Elastic)

- Published in IGARSS, ISPASS, and ASIANCON.
