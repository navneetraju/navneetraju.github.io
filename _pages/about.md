I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California pursuing a Master's in Applied Data Science. I have previously worked as a software engineer at the Intuit Data Exchange organisation at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/), where I worked on building document extraction and classification solutions.

I am passionate about data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 

Some of the areas I have worked on include:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition
- **Computer Vision**: Object Detection, Image Classification, Image Segmentation
- **Big data and Cloud Computing**: Real-time data processing, Data Pipelines, Cloud Computing, Benchmarking
